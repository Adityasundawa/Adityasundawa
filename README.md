#Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have a passion in programming, especially in website development. develop or create a website must be done optimally, in order to provide the best for customers. I master a number of things in website development such as PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Javascript. besides that I also mastered some PHP frameworks such as CodeIgniter, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Javascript frameworks like AJAX and JQuery.
